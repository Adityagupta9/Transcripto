 We meet again as we meet so often after these title wins.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:06
Do ask you something or you're going to tell me something anyway.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:08
It's better if you ask and then I reply.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:11
I asked you when you last won a trophy about the legacy you leave behind that CSK and you said I would left it behind yet.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:19
 So you look for an answer.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:21
If you search them strangely, if you see this is the best time for me to announce the retirement.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:27
But the amount of love and affection that I've been shown wherever I've been this year.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:33
I think the easy thing for me to say would be like, thank you very much.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:38
But the tough thing for me is to work hard for another nine months and come back and play at least one more season of fighting.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:45
 But a lot depends on the body.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:48
I have seven, six, seven months to decide.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:51
And I think, you know, it's something, it will be more like a gift from my side.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:56
It's not easy for me, but you know, that's a gift.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:58
The way they have shown their love and affection, I think that's something that I need to do for them.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:01:03
Normally MS, you don't show any emotion when you win or lose.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:01:07
The other day when I was doing it interview with you in Chepoch.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:01:10
 For the first time I got the impression as you were looking up at the crowd that I thought you showed a little bit of emotion.
