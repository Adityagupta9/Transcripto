 But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:08
 Well, they have to deal with the — look, there is institutional segregation in this country.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:13
And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that — redlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where — look, talk about education.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:22
I propose that what we take is those very poor schools — the Title I schools — triple the amount of money we spend, from $15 billion to $45 billion a year.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:30
Give every single teacher a raise to the equal raise of getting out of the $60,000 level.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_01 00:00:35
 Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:41
Folks have talked about in a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:46
In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:56
And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:01:03
 What is your plan to address segregation?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:01:05
And I'm not just talking about the achievement gap, but I'm talking about the opportunity gap in education.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:01:11
So I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that and.
