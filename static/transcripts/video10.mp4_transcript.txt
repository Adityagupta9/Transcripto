SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:08
I do on that.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:10

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:18

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:25
 I have one can I ask something, so what will happen in the try catch, what you mentioned, to know that.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:35
So in that particular example, it will get some compilation error, because already the exception is cashed by the super class that is exception.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:48
