SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:04
 OK, that's it.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:04
So can you just tell me why we are not considering map as a collection or why map is not considered as a collection?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:12
Any idea on that?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_03 00:00:15
Only I know is map can hold key value pairs, that's all.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:22
OK Vishal, so we are done with the technical round and shall we move on to the next round?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:29
 I have one.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:30
Can I ask something ma'am?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:33
So what will happen in the try catch what you mentioned?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_02 00:00:36
To know that.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:39
So in that particular example it will get some compilation error.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:46
Because already the exception is cached by the superclass that is exception.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:52
 OK, so already in the first catch block if we have mentioned exception, right?

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:00:56
So then there is no need to put the other subclass that is arithmetic exception.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:01:01
So hence we will get the compilation error.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_03 00:01:05
OK, thank you.

SPEAKER_SPEAKER_00 00:01:08
